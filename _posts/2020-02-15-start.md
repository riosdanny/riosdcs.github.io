Well, I've finally started a website. 

This is where I'll house my blog posts and projects. So, a typical developer website.

As for what sort of content the blog posts will contain, I imagine it'll be a mixture of:
* Project write-ups
* Stuff I'm experimenting with
* Intriguing content I've discovered and analysis of such
* Musings about the industry

Currently, the site is being hosted by GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. I am considering building it with React and building it through Gatsby or perhaps I'll using Python and Django. I'm still mulling it over. It would require a rewrite, of course, but it would be fun and a good chance to mess around.
