### Markdown Preview Enhanced

A subset of the CSS used when generating the HTML version of a file from within the Visual Studio Code extension with the corresponding name was used for the styling of portions of the pages within this entire project. 

The [.css](/assets/css/mpe-subset.css) and its accompanying [LICENSE](markdown-preview-enhanced/LICENSE) are included with this project

Slight modifications have been made to fit project design and were added in the file after the comment reading `/* personal modifications */`. Additionally, the above license has also been included at the top of that file.
